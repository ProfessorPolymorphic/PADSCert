    "text": "OVERVIEW\nWe live in an increasingly data-driven world. Basic data literacy and data science skills are becoming central to virtually every industry. Yet, limited opportunities exist to gain these skills without an advanced background in math and computer science. To address this workforce development need, we propose a competitively valued on-line graduate certificate in the Professional Applications in Data Science. The certificate is designed to offer rigorous training in the foundations of data science to anyone with a bachelor’s degree. Participants will learn how to think about, organize, analyze, and visualize data, and communicate data driven insights to diverse audiences. The curriculum emphasizes the use of data sets drawn from each student’s individual discipline, aligning the certificate’s workforce development impacts with the University of Idaho’s land grant mission.\n\nValue Proposition:\nThe graduate certificate in Professional Applications in Data Science will provide unique value to UI constituencies by:\n\nAligning data science training with fields of nascent demand that are part of our land grant mission, including Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Education.\nRequiring a digital data science portfolio with which students can demonstrate their proficiencies to potential employers.\nEmphasizing training in data communication - including verbal presentation and data visualization - two components of data science that are underrepresented in competing certificates.\nFilling a growing workforce development gap by offering a unique data science certificate that is appropriate for professionals with a bachelor’s degree who do not have a rigorous background in mathematics, statistics, or computer science.\n\n\n\nIntended Audience:\nThis certificate leverages the University of Idaho’s interdisciplinary culture to provide integrative training in the foundations of data science. It is intended for:\n\nWorking professionals with a bachelor’s degree whose career increasingly involves the generation, management, analysis, and visualization of large data sets. The certificate is appropriate for professionals in STEM fields, Health Care, Business, Government, Education, Journalism, Athletics, Natural Resources, and Agriculture.\nGraduate students in programs outside of the core technical disciplines of data science (statistics, math, engineering, or computer science). The certificate will complement disciplinary research methods courses with training in data management, visualization, and communication.\nUndergraduates at the UI who wish to incorporate data science training into their degree and graduate with a Bachelor’s degree and a graduate certificate.\n\n\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes:\nUpon completion of the certificate, students will be able to:\n\nUse open-source software to reproducibly manage, analyze, and visualize large, complex, and noisy data sets.\nPractice high quality and ethical data stewardship.\nUnderstand and execute data exploration.\nEffectively communicate data driven insights to experts and non-experts.\nDemonstrate their skills with an online portfolio of analyses and visualizations relevant to their field of specialization."
